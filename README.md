### User Stories

User Stories:

- Patients
  - As a patient I would like to be able to see the ratings of each ER that appear in my search so that I can make informed choices about what ER I go to.
  - As a patient I would like to access the website on my mobile device so that I can view the average wait time (duration or number of patients) on a computer / on my phone.
  - As a patient I would like to be able to compare wait times of surrounding ER‚Äôs in my area so that I can make informed choices about what ER I go to.

- Triage Nurses
  - As a triage nurse I would like to input patient information after triage of walk-in patients so that I can assign them to the appropriate waiting queue.
  - As a triage nurse I would like to be able to update patient priority so that I can accurately assign patients based on changing conditions.

- Triage Nurse / Provider
  - As a nurse or provider I would like to know the average queue wait for each priority value or queue so that I can see how busy the ER is.
  - As a nurse or provider I would like to register/login so that actions under my name are traceable to myself.

- Providers
  - As a provider I would like to know who the next highest-priority patient in the waiting line is, so that I can attend to that patient.

- Admin
  - As an administrator I would like to be able to login as an administrator so that I can perform admin functionality.
  - As an admin I would like to be able to add user roles for providers and nurses.
  - As an admin I would like to be able to delete a user. 
  - As an admin I would like to be able to see statistics for each doctor / nurse (stretch).

### Domain Modeling (in progress)

in progress

### Database Schema Diagram (in progress)

- create a diagram of all your application data models, each in it‚Äôs own collection (or table)

- Be sure to identify the relationships (if any) between each of your data models:

1. Does a single item in your database ‚Äúbelong to‚Äù just one other item in your database? For example, a person has one passport, and a passport belongs to a single person.
2. Does a item in your database ‚Äúbelong to‚Äù multiple other items in your database? For example, a house has many residents, and each resident has one primary house.
3. Do many items in your database relate to many other items in your database? For example, a band has many musicians, and a musician can be in many bands.
 
- Also, include for each seperate collection:

1. The name of each property stored in the collection.
2. The required data type.
3. An indication if this collection is associated with another collection.

- include explanation of each data model and it‚Äôs responsibility in the application
